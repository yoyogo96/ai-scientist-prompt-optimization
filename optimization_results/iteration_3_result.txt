**2. Case Studies**

**2.1 Bioinformatics**  
AI algorithms have revolutionized data processing in genomics, enabling faster sequencing and analysis. For instance, deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been instrumental in identifying genetic variants associated with diseases. A study by Esteva et al. (2017) demonstrated that AI could classify skin cancer images with an accuracy comparable to dermatologists, showcasing its potential to streamline diagnostics and enhance patient outcomes.

*Methodological Guidance:*  
- Use robust datasets (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) for training models.  
- Employ performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation to ensure model efficacy.  
- Address algorithmic bias by ensuring diverse representation in training datasets to avoid skewed results.

**2.2 Drug Discovery**  
AI accelerates drug discovery by predicting molecular interactions and optimizing compound structures. For instance, Atomwise's use of AI for virtual screening of compounds has led to the identification of potential drug candidates more efficiently than traditional methods. A case study involving the AI-driven identification of a treatment for the Ebola virus highlights AI's capacity to reduce the discovery timeline from years to months (Zhang et al., 2020).

*Methodological Guidance:*  
- Implement machine learning models, such as random forests and neural networks, for predictive analytics.  
- Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess model robustness and minimize overfitting.  
- Monitor for bias in chemical datasets to ensure a comprehensive exploration of diverse chemical spaces.
